# üöó Behavioral Cloning Project

[![Udacity - Self-Driving Car NanoDegree](https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-sdc/github/shield-carnd.svg)](http://www.udacity.com/drive)

## Overview
This project is part of the **Udacity Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree**. The goal is to train a deep neural network to clone driving behavior ‚Äî i.e., steer a simulated vehicle around a track using only images from a front-facing camera.

## üìÅ Project Structure

* model.py (script used to create and train the model)
* drive.py (script to drive the car - feel free to modify this file)
* model.h5 (a trained Keras model)
* a report writeup file (either markdown or pdf)
* video.mp4 (a video recording of your vehicle driving autonomously around the track for at least one full lap)


---

## üß† Approach

### Data Collection
- Collected driving data using the simulator's track 1.
- Recorded images from **center**, **left**, and **right** cameras.
- Captured ~X,000 images during smooth and recovery driving.

### Data Preprocessing
- Cropped sky and hood (top and bottom pixels).
- Resized to match input shape for the model (e.g., `66x200x3`).
- Normalized pixel values to range `[-0.5, 0.5]`.

### Data Augmentation
To improve generalization:
- Random brightness adjustment
- Horizontal flipping
- Steering angle correction for left/right images

### Model Architecture
Based on NVIDIA's end-to-end model:

```python
model = Sequential()
model.add(Lambda(lambda x: x / 255.0 - 0.5, input_shape=(160, 320, 3)))
model.add(Cropping2D(cropping=((70, 25), (0, 0))))
model.add(Conv2D(24, (5, 5), strides=(2, 2), activation='relu'))
model.add(Conv2D(36, (5, 5), strides=(2, 2), activation='relu'))
model.add(Conv2D(48, (5, 5), strides=(2, 2), activation='relu'))
model.add(Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'))
model.add(Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'))
model.add(Flatten())
model.add(Dense(100))
model.add(Dense(50))
model.add(Dense(10))
model.add(Dense(1))
```


### Dependencies
This lab requires:

* [CarND Term1 Starter Kit](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Term1-Starter-Kit)

The lab enviroment can be created with CarND Term1 Starter Kit. Click [here](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Term1-Starter-Kit/blob/master/README.md) for the details.

The following resources can be found in this github repository:
* drive.py
* video.py
* writeup_template.md

The simulator can be downloaded from the classroom. In the classroom, we have also provided sample data that you can optionally use to help train your model.

## Details About Files In This Directory

### `drive.py`

Usage of `drive.py` requires you have saved the trained model as an h5 file, i.e. `model.h5`. See the [Keras documentation](https://keras.io/getting-started/faq/#how-can-i-save-a-keras-model) for how to create this file using the following command:
```sh
model.save(filepath)
```

Once the model has been saved, it can be used with drive.py using this command:

```sh
python drive.py model.h5
```

The above command will load the trained model and use the model to make predictions on individual images in real-time and send the predicted angle back to the server via a websocket connection.

Note: There is known local system's setting issue with replacing "," with "." when using drive.py. When this happens it can make predicted steering values clipped to max/min values. If this occurs, a known fix for this is to add "export LANG=en_US.utf8" to the bashrc file.

#### Saving a video of the autonomous agent

```sh
python drive.py model.h5 run1
```

The fourth argument, `run1`, is the directory in which to save the images seen by the agent. If the directory already exists, it'll be overwritten.

```sh
ls run1

```

The image file name is a timestamp of when the image was seen. This information is used by `video.py` to create a chronological video of the agent driving.

### `video.py`

```sh
python video.py run1
```

Creates a video based on images found in the `run1` directory. The name of the video will be the name of the directory followed by `'.mp4'`, so, in this case the video will be `run1.mp4`.

Optionally, one can specify the FPS (frames per second) of the video:

```sh
python video.py run1 --fps 48
```

Will run the video at 48 FPS. The default FPS is 60.

#### Why create a video

1. It's been noted the simulator might perform differently based on the hardware. So if your model drives succesfully on your machine it might not on another machine (your reviewer). Saving a video is a solid backup in case this happens.
2. You could slightly alter the code in `drive.py` and/or `video.py` to create a video of what your model sees after the image is processed (may be helpful for debugging).

### Tips
- Please keep in mind that training images are loaded in BGR colorspace using cv2 while drive.py load images in RGB to predict the steering angles.
